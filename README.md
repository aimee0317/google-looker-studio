# E-commerce Website Analytics Dashboard with Google Looker Studio and Google Analytics 4

### Project Overview 
The dashboard below is designed using canva.com and implemented in Google Looker Studio (previously called "Google Data Studio") using data from Google Analytics 4.

### Data Source 
The e-commerce website is for a used computer and electronic store local to Vancouver. It has been a successful business but would like some online exposure. The data used in this data visualization project is from Google Analytics 4. I tagged the e-commerce website using Google Tag Manager and tracked website data for 2 months.

### Proposal 
While Google Analytics 4 offers dashboard customization features, I chose to import the Google Analytics 4 data into Google Looker Studio to build the dashboard for the following reasons: 
- Google Looker Studio allows for more extensive customization options, enabling the creation of more complex and visually appealing dashboards.
- Google Looker Studio offers advanced analytics features, including modeling, calculations, and data exploration, providing deeper insights into the data.
However, an advantage of using the Google Analytics 4 dashboard is that it provides real-time data, whereas Looker Studio processes data in batches. It's important to note that real-time data might be beneficial for websites with highly frequent and time-sensitive activities. However, since the website's activities don't occur very frequently and the focus is on long-term business strategies, real-time data doesn't seem to be extremely necessary for this specific scenario.

#### Final DashboardS 
**Note:** The final dashboards contain sensitive internal data, so I have covered the actual numbers and metrics, and will only show the structure of the dashboard.
